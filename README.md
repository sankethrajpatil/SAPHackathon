# SAPHackathon

##Guide for website
Click the link here to get a direct preview of what we have done: https://identifying-employee-burnout.herokuapp.com/ (However, this link is not the latest submission of the team, the latest submission of the team happens to be the index.py file of this GIT)

1. The Home page is an intro, the EDA page is to see and check all the Exploratory Data Analysis and the 'Are you burntout?' page is where you check whether you are burntout. 
2. In the Are you burnout page, enter a random employee ID and Project Id, those two inputs will be used for official purposes and they DO NOT contribute to the ML model.
3. Answer the respective questions, honestly to see how burnout you are and hit predict to see the outcome. 

##Instructions to run the files on your local system
1. Download the index file, there are certain libraries mentioned in the index file, pip install them if you haven't.
2. The index.py file is dependent on two csv files attatched in the repo as well
3. Open cmd or open VSC (If VSC, then click on Run Active File, command prompt opens below)
4. Enter the path where your index.py file is there properly in cmd
5. To run, type the following "streamlit run index.py"
6. A localhost server will be deployed where you can see the code

##What are the other files then?
1. The other files are Jupyter files where we used a lot of Data Science and ML libraries
2. Their purpose stands in the naming of their file and a lot of comments that have been put up
3. Run them how normally run Jupyter files with the excel files inputted properly
4. The Best model file really stands out because it tests almost all the algorithms and tells us which ones are the best suited
